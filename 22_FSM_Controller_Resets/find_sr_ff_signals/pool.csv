Title,Find State Register SR Signals
QuestionText,<p> Suppose you are using flip-flops with synchronous set and reset inputs         to implement a 3-bit state register as shown above.             You want the FSM to reset to state <b>000</b> when a signal <i>r</i> is high.                 What signals should go into the flip-flops' set and reset inputs?                 Match them below. </p>,HTML
