OPTION,0,The signal Q will suffer from glitches before settling to an unpredictable value,HTML
OPTION,0,"The signal Q will still be in an unknown state, which may or may not be correct",HTML
OPTION,100,The signal Q will stay in the correct state because c settled quickly enough to avoid violations,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will stay in the correct state regardless of how quickly c settles,HTML
