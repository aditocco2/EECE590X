<p>You may recall that multiplication on paper is done by multiplying the entire top number by one digit of the bottom number at a time to create partial products, and then adding them all up, like so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;">           1   
        1 2 3
   *    2 1 4
   -----------
        4 9 2
      1 2 3 0
    2 4 6 0 0
   -----------
    2 6 0 7 6</pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same algorithm can be used for binary numbers. Making the partial products is even easier: You either copy the number down if the digit is 1 (since multiplying by 1 is the identity) or just write down 0 if the digit is 0 (anything times 0 is 0). The example below shows the binary equivalent of 11 * 5 = 55:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;">         1 0 1 1
  *      0 1 0 1
   ---------------
         1 0 1 1
       0 0 0 0 0
     1 0 1 1 0 0
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0
   ----------------
   0 1 1 0 1 1 1</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose you were making a combinational multiplier that took two [REPLACE]-bit numbers as its inputs. How many [REPLACE]-bit adders would you need to use in this design?</p>
