<p>Suppose you wanted to make a 4-bit<strong> magnitude comparator</strong> to determine which of two numbers, A or B, is greater than the other.</p>
<p>This can be done by checking the result of a subtraction between the two numbers. First, we add a 0 to the left of each 4-bit input to make it a 5-bit number. Then, we can plug A and B into a 5-bit subtractor as shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code>&nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; A[3] B[3]&nbsp; A[2] B[2]&nbsp; A[1] B[1]&nbsp; A[0] B[0]<br />____|____|_____|____|_____|____|_____|____|_____|____|____<br />|&nbsp; A[4] B[4]&nbsp; A[3] B[3]&nbsp; A[2] B[2]&nbsp; A[1] B[1]&nbsp; A[0] B[0]&nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5-Bit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subtractor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(A - B)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|______D[4]______D[3]_______D[2]______D[1]______D[0]______|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />R[4]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R[3]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;R[2]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R[1]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R[0]</code></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using the result R from this method, how can we tell if<strong>&nbsp;[REPLACE]?</strong></p>
