OPTION,0,The signal Q will still suffer glitches because b caused a setup time violation,HTML
OPTION,100,The signal Q is now synchronized and stable,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will still suffer glitches because b did not settle quickly enough,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q has a high likelihood of going into the incorrect state,HTML
