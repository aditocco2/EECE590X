OPTION,100,The signal Q will now become unpredictable because c took too long to settle,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will stay stable because there is still a transition on c from 0 to 1,HTML
OPTION,0,"The signal Q will suffer from glitches, but eventually settle into the correct state",HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will stay stable because c settled before the next clock edge,HTML
