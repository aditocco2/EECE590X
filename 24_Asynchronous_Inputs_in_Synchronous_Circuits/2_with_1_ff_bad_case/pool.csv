OPTION,0,"The signal Q will suffer from glitches, then be forced into the incorrect state",HTML
OPTION,100,The signal Q will become unpredictable because c took too long to settle,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will stay stable because there is still a transition on c from 0 to 1,HTML
OPTION,0,The signal Q will stay stable because there are no setup time violations in c,HTML
