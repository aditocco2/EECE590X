Title,Determine When The Output Changes
QuestionText,"In the circuit above, the input D changes at 0 ns.                 The control signal C goes from low to high at 10 ns                 and toggles every 10 ns after that.                 At what time will the change in D reflect on the output?",NOT HTML
