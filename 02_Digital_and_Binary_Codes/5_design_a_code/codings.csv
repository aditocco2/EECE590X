Title,Develop a code
QuestionText,"You are designing a digital circuit which can process 3 unique values, called Value_A through Value_C.  Before starting the design, you must first decide on a method to encode the values. For efficiency, you should use the fewest number of bits possible to encode the values. In the box below, enter a possible encoding for the 3 values: Value_A, Value_B, Value_C",NOT HTML
