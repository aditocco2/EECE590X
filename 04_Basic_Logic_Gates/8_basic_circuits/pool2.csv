Title,Choose basic circuit (fixed)
QuestionText,"<p>A security system has two inputs. The first input is X, a 'window open' signal                     which is 1 if a window is open and 0 if it's closed. The second input is                     Y, a 'motion detected' signal that is 1 if motion is detected and 0 otherwise.</p>                     <p>Choose a system above whose output F will be <b>'1'</b> when both the window is open and there is motion detected.</p>",HTML
