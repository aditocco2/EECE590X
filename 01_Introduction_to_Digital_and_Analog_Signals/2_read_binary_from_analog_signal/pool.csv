Title,Read binary bits in analog signal
QuestionText,"<p>In practical applications, engineers use <b>analog signals</b>
to describe <b>digital signals</b>, since electricity is an analog
phenomena. The waveform depicts an <i>analog signal</i> 
which is being used to transmit <i>binary digital information</i></p>
<p>If the system considers any voltage greater than 3V
to be a '1', and any lesser value a '0', what information is being 
expressed at each of time index shown in the figure?
