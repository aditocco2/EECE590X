Title,Analyze Each State of FSM
QuestionText,"<p>The FSM above was <i>supposed</i> to count upwards in place if the input is high and stay in the same state otherwise, but unfortunately,             there were a few mistakes in its design. Analyze each state of this FSM and match it                 with the correct description.</p>",HTML
